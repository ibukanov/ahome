Preface (or one year later)
</H2>
<p>
At the beginning of February 1997 I decided to write something useful in Java 
that would give me a feel of the language and its abilities. At that moment 
it looked like I had got a couple of months to fulfil the wish before my 
<a href="http://www.fi.uib.no/~boukanov/dipl/">Master thesis</a> deadline at 
<a href="http://www.fi.uib.no/">The Department of Physics</a> would come too 
close to do anything else except writing them in TeX. I weighted several 
ideas and finally chosen to make 
a <a href="http://www.javasoft.com/">Java</a> implementation of 
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/tech/desktop/x/">X11</a> 
protocol. 
But the protocol itself is not a big deal - I had to have some client to 
demonstrate how it would work and an idea came in mind to have 
a version of <a href="http://home.netscape.com/">Netscape</a>
<a href="http://developer.netscape.com/library/ifc/">Internet 
Foundation Classes</a> (IFC) 
that would use my implementation to do the GUI 
instead of standard Java AWT. 
Well, that was a bad idea not only because 
nowdays Netscape decided to forget about that very nice libarary but mostly 
due to Netscape code license. It gives access to the source but does not 
permit me to redistribute modifications - so I can not show that code 
and that brought usefulness of  my efforts to other people to almost zero. 
Yes, it was very good training but sometimes it is nice to have something 
to share with others. For example, it would take just little more time to write
some pure X Window Manager, i.e. one similar to fvwm.
</p>
<p>
So given that it is quite ironic for me to read the following text that 
I wrote a year ago when the X+IFC package started to work almost 
without problems.

Design 
</H2>

<P>
The main goal of the implementation is neither to write the full analog of 
X library in Java nor to provide an alternative implementation of Java AWT 
on the base of Java Xlib but to show the ability
to support rich GUI(Graphic User Interface) framework entirely in Java. 
Another purpose is to compare the performance of Java applications
when they use the standard AWT implementation built upon native Xlib 
in UNIX implementations of Java and when they use my implementation 
of X11 protocol directly.
</p>
<p>
To simplify the task I decided to take
<a href="http://developer.netscape.com/library/ifc/">IFC 1.0</a> 
as a base and to implement only those parts of the X protocol that 
are necessary to run IFC based applications.

<P>
There are several points that I gained from this decision.
<UL>
<LI> IFC takes not so much from Java AWT. 
It includes graphics, event handlings
and frames and it does not need any AWT controls because it draws all controls
by itself!
</LI>
<LI> IFC has a good documentation and its source <strong>is</strong> available.
</LI>
<LI> Netscape provides several nice examples that shows
almost all sides of the IFC library. They were indeed very good tests 
for my implementation and helped me to find some bugs.
</LI>
<LI> IFC provides the <strong>full</strong> GUI support and IFC applications 
do need to use AWT at all in almost all cases. That is way the library 
can be treated as a powerful program interface to any particular GUI
and pure IFC applications can be running under completely new implementation
<strong>without any modifications or recompilations</strong>. 
</LI>
<LI> IFC is quite flexible and for this reason I easily modified it 
in the way that permits to use both the standard AWT graphics
and the direct X11 one simultaneously. For example, the decision to use either 
AWT or X11 is done at run-time that is very helpful during tests. I just need
to change a command line to alter some arguments that tells haw to draw 
graphics.
</LI>
</UL> 
</P>

<P>
And of cause I lost quite significant thing. 
To obtain the source I signed the 
<a href="http://developer.netscape.com/library/ifc/downloads/sdk_license.html"
>license</a>, which in particular does not permit me to distribute 
modified IFC source or compiled Java classes.  So currently you may not access 
the part with the modified IFC code.
</P>

<H2>
Current limitations 
</H2>

<P>
I did not implement features that I am not able to test. 
This list include the support for gray X server visuals, 
the program just shows
(I suppose) everything in the black color on them.
</P>

<P>
The current code is not thread safe (IFC does not need that) 
although it supports the possibility
for finalize methods to be called from any thread.
So classes that handle X-resources can always have a chance to free  
the server ids. I found out that a straightforward approach to thread safeness
can lead to some performance problems under UNIX Java,
although it seams a more elaborated one is free from them.
I will definitely fix this after I will finish my diploma  
thesis. 
</P>

<P>
Due to tight binding of images with the rest part of GUI in AWT 
I had to write an image support by myself in Java to avoid completely 
the need in AWT native libraries. Currently it available only for GIFs
and it is slow (on UNIX a native image code is 10-20 times faster). 
This AWT-image link is just another
inconsistency in Java. For example I may want to write a code that do a simple
image transformations (make black-and-white images from color ones, 
change color values etc.) and store the results in files or send 
them to clients through a network. Then to get
an access to a native code to get image objects in the device independent 
representation (this code is completely decoupled from the rest 
of AWT in the Sun Java) I have to (implicitly) initialize the whole AWT 
which may not be available at all. It is quite often the case 
for UNIX boxes where server applications may have not an access to 
a GUI terminal...

Source
</H2>
<P>

The main part of the source code is available at 
<a href="lib.x.current.tgz">lib.x.current.tgz</a> as a tar gzip archive
or at  <a href="lib.x.current.zip">lib.x.current.zip</a>
as a zip archive. Important note: It <strong>does</strong> contain
long file names. You may also just browse the directory 
<a href="lib/">lib</a> to see may activity.
</P>

<P>
Please note that I will probably rewrite some code such as 
GIF decompression in 
<a href="http://found.cs.nyu.edu/meyer/jasmin/">Jasmin</a>
Java assembler. It can really 
improve the performance. An early example of such activity 
is present at <a href="lib/x/asm.jas">lib/x/asm.jas</a>, the alternative
Java source is at <a href="lib/x/asm.java">lib/x/asm.java</a>.

How to run test
</H2>
<P>
After you extract the archive to some directory you may want to add
that directory to your CLASSPATH environment variable. The archive already 
contains classes necessary to run a very test application 
<a href="lib/x/XTest.java">lib.x.XTest</a> but you may also 
compile them from a command line in the installation directory 
<pre>
javac -O lib/x/XTest.java     or    javac -O lib\x\XTest.java
</pre>
To run this test you have to provide X display name via the property 
"X.DISPLAY".
With JDK you can type:
<pre>
java -DX.DISPLAY=[InternetHostAddress:0] lib.x.XTest [Gif-URL]
</pre>
[Gif-URL] is an optional url that points to any Gif image. 
(It includes transparent ones.) 
It may take quite a lot of time to start, so please be patient.
When and if it runs, you may press F12 to close the program, g to show
Gif image (please be patient again!), +/- to shrink/scretch the window,
1-2-3-4 to show some bitmaps etc. 
This is really just a little feature test. 
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> The current version does not support X authority 
so switch it off to run the test.
<HR>
<H2>
Bind with IFC
</H2>
<P>
The main code for IFC support is at 
<a href="netscape/application/ImplementationX.java"
>netscape/application/ImplementationX.java</a>, which also contains
a real example of XEvents processing. Due to the mentioned problems I can not 
give the whole source of the modified IFC 1.0 that permits 
to run almost all IFC examples at <a href="ifc/examples/">ifc/examples/</a> 
as pure Java X clients.
