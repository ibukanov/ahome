   Dear Mikhail Il'ich,
   
   I am very sorry I trouble you but I will be very grateful to you if you
   could help me. My name is Igor Boukanov.
    Now I am a student at the University of Bergen (Norway) but before I was 
    a student at Minsk University. 
   I will be very thankful to you if you could help me with some problem 
   I am trying to undestand. 
   Yakov Mikhailovich Shnir kindly present me his Berlin's account for 
   sending of this message.  
   
   Could you please to give me any information about the problem which can
    be formulated in the next way.
   Let us consider the definition of the Chern numbers $c_{(2)}$, $c_{(1,\,1)}$
in the case of complex connection
on any compact orientable 4-dimentional manifold $M_4$
(unfortunatly, there are no any common notation of the Chern numbers, I will use 
ones used in standard textbook by M.M.Postnikov "Differencial'naja geometrija", 
Moskva, 1989, page 397):

$$
  c_{(2)}  = {1 \over 4\pi^2} \int_{M_4} det\,F\,, 
$$
$$
  c_{(1,\,1)} = {1 \over 4\pi^2} \int_{M_4} Tr(F) \wedge Tr(F), 
$$
where $F = d\!A + A \wedge A$ is field 2-form on $M_4$. 

Consider now U(2) connection which can be represented by 
antihermitian 2x2 matrix $A$. In this case for traceless part of $A$:
$$A_0 = A - {1 \over 2} Tr\, A$$
by using that for any 2x2 matrix $X$:
$$
   det(X - {1 \over 2} Tr(X)) = det X - {1 \over 4} Tr(X) 
$$
I have:
$$
  c_{(2)}(F_0)  = {1 \over 4\pi^2} \int_{M_4} det(F_0) \quad = \quad
  {1 \over 4\pi^2} \int_{M_4} det(F - {1 \over 2} Tr\, F)
$$
$$
  = {1 \over 4\pi^2} \int_{M_4} det(F) \quad -  \quad
    {1 \over 4} {1 \over 4\pi^2} \int_{M_4} Tr(F) \wedge Tr(F)  \quad = \quad
    c_{(2)}(F) - {1 \over 4}c_{(1,\,1)}(F)  
$$  
   This lead when $c_{(2)}(F) = c_{(1,\,1)}(F) = 1$ to 
$$
c_{(2)}(F_0) = k = {3 \over 4}
$$ 
where k is just standard definition for topological charge (winding number):
$$
   k =  -{1 \over 8\pi^2} \int_{M_4} Tr(F_0 \wedge F_0)
$$

  This lead to conclusion that $A_0$ does not correspond to any SU(2) connection 
because k is not an integer. If it is correct, the questions is:

Is it possible in any way to construct from 
U(2) a "normal" SU(2) connection for which $c_{(2)} \equiv k$ will be integer?

I am looking forward of your reply.

Sincerely yours,

Igor Boukanov
