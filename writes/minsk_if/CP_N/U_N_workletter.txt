When I left Minsk I promised to represent to you a calculation of an instanton
connection in the $CP^N$ case in a few weak but because I have got some 
underwater stones in the calculation it caused delay. Unfortunatly, in the 
parametrization of hamiltonian of $N+1$ system with $N$ degeneration as:
$$H = U^+H_0U$$ 
with $U = \exp A$, $A_{00} = 0$, $A_{ij} = 0$, $A_{i0} = \ksi_i$,
A_{0i} = -(\ksi_i)^*$, $i,j = 1..N$ I was able to get expression only for 
2 topological charges (both are one) and even in this case 
the calculation was very tedious. So I decided to change the parametrization 
of H and in this new one I have done nexts items:
1. Calculation of $A$ and $F$ and explicit expression for them via 
parameters of $H$.
2. Calculation of all possible charges. (All of them are 1.)



I think I will have typed the detailed calculations with a lot of comments 
before 15.09.96 and I think the article based on this can be finished before 
01.10.96. (Hope...)
