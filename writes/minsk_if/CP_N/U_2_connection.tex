\centerline{Dear Artur Yaroslavovich,} 
I think it was very good questions about  
"the rest of the connection corresponding to the nondegenerate level" 
because this brings the answer why 
$$
   -{1 \over 8\pi^2} \int Tr(F_0 \wedge F_0), \quad where \quad 
F_0 = F_0 - {1 \over 2}Tr(F)
$$ should be ${3 \over 4}$ !

Follow the example 1 from M.M.Postnikov's book  "Differencial'naja geometrija",
page 397:

For any 2x2 matrix X 
$$
   Tr({X_0}^2) = -2\,det\,X_0 = -2\,det(X-{1 \over 2}Tr(X))
    = -2\,(det\,X - {1 \over 4}Tr(X)^2.
$$
because $Tr(X_0) \equiv Tr(X-{1 \over 2}Tr(X)) = 0$. So:
$$
   -{1 \over 8\pi^2} \int Tr(F_0 \wedge F_0) = 
   {1 \over 4\pi^2} \left( \int det(F) - \int Tr(F)^2 \right) = 
   c_{(2)} - {1 \over 4}c_{(1,\,1)}
$$
where
$$
  c_{(2)} = {1 \over 4\pi^2} \int det\,F\,, \qquad
  c_{(1,\,1)} = {1 \over 4\pi^2} \int Tr(F) \wedge Tr(F) 
$$
is Chern numbers.

According to a Chern number properties 
$c_{(2)}$ and $c_{(1,\,1)}$ should be integers, so I check this 
for $2+1$ system with $$A = {1 \over 1 + r^2} xd\!x^+.$$ The result was:
$$
c_{(2)} = 1, \qquad c_{(1,\,1)} = 1 
$$
this gives:
$$
  -{1 \over 8\pi^2} \int Tr(F_0 \wedge F_0) = 1 - {1 \over 4}1 = {3 \over 4}
$$
with conformation of my previous calculations. 

"${3 \over 4}$" just shows that in a general case topological charge can not 
be calculated by using "standard formula":
$$
   {\it k} = -{1 \over 8\pi^2} \int Tr(F_0 \wedge F_0) 
$$
and one should use the definition of $c_2$ instead. 

And because for monopol like connection $c_{(1,\,1)} = 1$, $c_{(2)} = 0$, for
instanton like connection $c_{(1,\,1)} = 0$, $c_{(2)} = 1$ this case of 
$U(2)$ connection on $CP^2$ with $c_{(1,\,1)} = 1$, $c_{(2)} = 1$ introduce
something new.

With best regards, Igor Boukanov.

P.S.
   I checked that of cause $CP^2$ is orientable and my last e-mail question 
was only due to gaps in the education...
